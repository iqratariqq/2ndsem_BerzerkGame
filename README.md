## 🧩 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET (Windows Forms)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Programming Style:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## 🔍 OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation:** Each game object is handled through its own class.
- **Inheritance:** Common logic is shared between player and enemies.
- **Polymorphism:** Object behaviors are customized using overridden methods.
- **Abstraction:** Complex game logic is handled behind clean interfaces.
